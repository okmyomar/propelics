# What is this about?

This is a sample about the power of javascript, here you will find some simple features implementations about ECMAScript v5, the test is composed by the next elements:

  - Function that receives a String parameter and returns how many vowels that string has.
  - A function that receives 2 Date parameters and returns the time difference in minutes.
  - A function that receives 1 Object parameter that can contain strings, boolean, integer, undefined and null values. It should create and return an array of 3 key-value objects. The first include all strings and integer key values, the second all boolean key values and last one all the null key values.

  - A calculator which evaluates expressions with decimal numbers and the operators + , - , * , / and prints the result on the screen (don't use eval() ). No user input for this is needed, instead you will give a string with the operation as an input i.e. if it receives 5+4-2 the result printed on screen is 7 .
  - Given 2 strings of unknown characters (but it can't be repeated) create a function that returns an array of the characters that are repeated in both strings in the most efficient way.
  - Create an array of objects (fill it with at least 10 elements) in which each object represents a movie . Each movie can have a title (String), starring (Array of Strings), isFavorite (Boolean) and Score (Number, can have decimals)

    properties.

1. Write a function that prints the whole list of movies ordered by:

* title
* score
* isFavorite

    Make sure it receives a parameter for indicatinf if sorting is going to be ascending or descending.

2. A function that prints the whole list of movies so it looks like:
    ````
    <Title> starring <Actor1, Actor2, ... ActorN> has a score of <Score>
    ````
  - Write a program that computes a math function.
  - Write a function that tests whether a string is a palindrome.
  - Write a function that prints the next 20 leap years.
